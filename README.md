This repository documents my learning journey in Azure Data Engineering. It includes practical examples, project walkthroughs, notes, and hands-on experiments with various Azure services such as Azure Synapse, Data Factory, Data Lake, Databricks, and more. The goal is to build a comprehensive guide and reference for data engineering best practices, architecture patterns, and real-world data processing scenarios on Azure.
